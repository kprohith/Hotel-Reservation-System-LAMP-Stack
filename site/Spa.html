	MEDITATION CLASSES</h1></font>
	<p>As people continue to strive for the perfect work-life balance, our Spa is offering <br>complimentary daily 20-minute mindfulness meditation classes over lunchtime to<br> raise awareness of the benefits of coping with stress and anxiety in the workplace. 
<br><br>
Mindfulness meditation is an adaptation of Buddhist meditation, which encourages <br>one to focus on the moment rather than being consumed by the pain of the past or <br>anxiety over the future. Spa therapists have been practising daily meditation since<br> the launch of our Spa in 2009 to find personal balance, as it also helps them sense<br> and craft unique and tailored treatments for our guests.
<br><br>
Guests are welcomed in the lobby by a spa representative and ushered to the spa <br>into a cool and dimly-lit treatment room where they are asked to remove their shoes<br> and turn off any technological equipment. René Van Eyssen, our Spa Director, explains,<br> “Meditation encourages you to observe your emotions, which improves awareness of<br> the present moment, bringing clarity and peace. The result is a total renewal of mind and<br> spirit.” <br><br>
